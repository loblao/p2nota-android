# p2nota
Android app for managing P+ grades

P+ Notas (aka _p2nota_) is an extension app for [P+](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.daitangroup.poliedro.activitymanager). When you login, your grades are download and displayed by subject. In addition, the number of hits required to pass (ie. get average 6) in P2 is calculated, based on P1 and bonuses. If P2 is already available, the app will inform whether the student has been approved in that bimester or should proceed to recuperation. In that case, the amount of missing points is also shown.

P+ Notas is now available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.p2nota.android).
